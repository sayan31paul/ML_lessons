Since the bubble is growing slowly, its radius is increasing. Because radius is increasing, its total distance from the pivot; i.e. its diameter, is also increasing. So the torque applied by gravity, which would otherwise have been negligible due to the bubble\\'s lack of significant mass, also becomes a factor. Thus, the air blown through the bubble maker should exert a force at the center such that the torque counteracts the torque exerted by gravity.

I did work very hard for IIT but could not clear even the screening entrance in 10+2 . Then I dropped 1year and went to Delhi and took admission in PIE education with 28000 fees. I again could not clear screening even though I was doing well in test series. I almost went into depression as I was mocked among my relatives and friends that i wasted so much money.☹️☹️ But God had some other plans for me.. In 2002 AIEEE was launched first time and I got AIR of 4000 and got admission in a decent college. Then I went ahead, did my MBA from one if India\\'s top 10 B schools in 2009 to 2011. I am currently working as a Project Lead with BCG consulting and have package..1 Cr+. Many IITians are my juniors in office. When I reflect back, I think God came to my rescue when I failed in IIT screening twice and did not go into depression, clearing AIEEE with a decent rank was God\\'s intervention.. 😀 So friends have faith in God.. and keep doing your karma.. !!

I almost went into depression as I was mocked among my relatives and friends that i wasted so much money.☹️☹️ But God had some other plans for me.. In 2002 AIEEE was launched first time and I got AIR of 4000 and got admission in a decent college. Then I went ahead, did my MBA from one if India's top 10 B schools in 2009 to 2011. I am currently working as a Project Lead with BCG consulting and have package..1 Cr+. Many IITians are my juniors in office. When I reflect back, I think God came to my rescue when I failed in IIT screening twice and did not go into depression, clearing AIEEE with a decent rank was God's intervention.. 😀 So friends have faith in God.. and keep doing your karma.. !!
