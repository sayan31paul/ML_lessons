Current M21 is already running in android 12 from android 10. So future updates is not an issue. Atleast we can expect 2 major updates.\\n3. Charger included in box (15w)\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Lag lag lag. Even the UI transition every thing is lagging like hell. I dont know how it passed QC. Basic operations like going to contacts, app view , setting everything lags like hell.\\n2. Device feels heavy due to 6000mah battery\\n3. very very mediocre camera. Okaish output. I am not expecting output like iphone or samsung premium mobiles. But atleast equal to the competitors like redmi at same price range.\\n4. They should move out of 15w charger to atleast 25w qualcomm support. Due to large battery capacity takes long time to charge device to full.\\n5. Loading web pages with lots of images is going to be a problem. For e.g., some people have google news as default home page. For them its going to be really slow.\\n6. Missing amoled which is thr in current m21.\\n\\nVerdict: If you need a branded device at 11 to 14k budget then go to this device. If not go to redmi 10s or iqoo or poco mobiles as they offer better value of money.\\n\\nAs soon as I held the device it felt little bit heavy.',\n",

       " 'processor, battery are ok , Fingerprint sensor,camera and UI not goodAfter a long span of time say 3 years, im back to Samsung. Now, Samsung realise that selling their name is no more working and reduce the price at the level of other company to success in the market . I bought 6 gb one and very happy with it now.\\nHowever, as before, many of the inbuild apps irritating me which are not uninstallable.\\nAfter using it for 3 months plus, let me give my fair opinion:\\n1. Battery life makes me happy, but fast charging needs 2 hrs plus is little bit annoying.\\n2. Camera must not be more than 12 Megapixel. As compared to my previous phone MI Note 6 pro, I dont see any better snap here.\\n3. Finger print sensor is absolutely annoying. Most time i have to enter my password manually as FP sensor do not detect my fingerprint. How my previous phone MI Note 6 pro nicely detects my fingerprint and easily open phone has been missing here.\\n4. As MAH is more, thr weight of phone is bit heavy. I dont know why Silicon cover of around Rs 99 approx cannot be attached here in the package!! I bought silicon cover from Amazon but lately arrived which cause my phone screeen crack due to fallen from my bed. If it was in Silicon cover, the Lcd must have been intact till now. MI 6 Pro had come with one extra phone safety cover but Samsung cannot.\\n5. After two years , I come to Samsung again hoping much UI improvement. However, i found Samsung do not compete with even MI in certain ways. I need to put Alarm clock on, i can easily go directly to all clock setting by clicking wall paper clock in MI while this phone need me to go to the clock in menu and so. When a turn on torch, i can easily turn it off by pressing power button in MI while this phone needs me to open screen and tap on torch icon in menu manually\\nAs off now, i can point out these points to ascertain my judgement. I will comeback after using a year if get time',\n",

I am a frequent traveller and caller so was looking for a budgetary phone which has most of the features along with good battery backup. This meets my requirement.\\nPros:\\n- Fit and finish is very good\\n- Good battery backup\\n- Performance is good with fast response\\n- Storage and ram is sufficient as I opted for 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage variant\\n- Responsive finger printing sensor\\n- Loud and clear sound with and without speaker for calls\\n- Clear voice calling\\n\\nCons:\\n- Heavy weight makes it difficult to hold and use\\n- The screen is HD only. Not even FHD but supports 1080 p video viewing\\n- 4 K videos will never play in 4 K mode. Only can be played in 1080 p resolution\\n- No gyroscope and magnetometer sensor which means, compass application and some games which use these sensors will never work\\n- No Corning Gorilla class. Screen is prone to scratches without cover\\n- Sound is below average for music listeners\\n- Double tap doesn’t work to wake up the screen\\n\\nConclusion:\\nOnly go for this if you are using for phone calls with good battery backup. Not worth for entertainment purpose. I can still survive on this as I have an iPad for entertainment.

       " 'processor, battery are ok , Fingerprint sensor,camera and UI not goodAfter a long span of time say 3 years, im back to Samsung. Now, Samsung realise that selling their name is no more working and reduce the price at the level of other company to success in the market . I bought 6 gb one and very happy with it now.\\nHowever, as before, many of the inbuild apps irritating me which are not uninstallable.\\nAfter using it for 3 months plus, let me give my fair opinion:\\n1. Battery life makes me happy, but fast charging needs 2 hrs plus is little bit annoying.\\n2. Camera must not be more than 12 Megapixel. As compared to my previous phone MI Note 6 pro, I dont see any better snap here.\\n3. Finger print sensor is absolutely annoying. Most time i have to enter my password manually as FP sensor do not detect my fingerprint. How my previous phone MI Note 6 pro nicely detects my fingerprint and easily open phone has been missing here.\\n4. As MAH is more, thr weight of phone is bit heavy. I dont know why Silicon cover of around Rs 99 approx cannot be attached here in the package!! I bought silicon cover from Amazon but lately arrived which cause my phone screeen crack due to fallen from my bed. If it was in Silicon cover, the Lcd must have been intact till now. MI 6 Pro had come with one extra phone safety cover but Samsung cannot.\\n5. After two years , I come to Samsung again hoping much UI improvement. However, i found Samsung do not compete with even MI in certain ways. I need to put Alarm clock on, i can easily go directly to all clock setting by clicking wall paper clock in MI while this phone need me to go to the clock in menu and so. When a turn on torch, i can easily turn it off by pressing power button in MI while this phone needs me to open screen and tap on torch icon in menu manually\\nAs off now, i can point out these points to ascertain my judgement. I will comeback after using a year if get time',\n",

I am a frequent traveller and caller so was looking for a budgetary phone which has most of the features along with good battery backup. This meets my requirement.\\nPros:\\n- Fit and finish is very good\\n- Good battery backup\\n- Performance is good with fast response\\n- Storage and ram is sufficient as I opted for 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage variant\\n- Responsive finger printing sensor\\n- Loud and clear sound with and without speaker for calls\\n- Clear voice calling\\n\\nCons:\\n- Heavy weight makes it difficult to hold and use\\n- The screen is HD only. Not even FHD but supports 1080 p video viewing\\n- 4 K videos will never play in 4 K mode. Only can be played in 1080 p resolution\\n- No gyroscope and magnetometer sensor which means, compass application and some games which use these sensors will never work\\n- No Corning Gorilla class. Screen is prone to scratches without cover\\n- Sound is below average for music listeners\\n- Double tap doesn’t work to wake up the screen\\n\\nConclusion:\\nOnly go for this if you are using for phone calls with good battery backup. Not worth for entertainment purpose. I can still survive on this as I have an iPad for entertainment. Samsung is marketing it in such a way where none of the sensors specifications and entertainment features are mentioned clearly on the website as it is not having any of them.

       " 'Couldn\\'t meet my expectationsI expected a lot about samsung mobiles in this price segment, but after buying it I totally regret myself.. But as a reviewer, I would like to post the pros and cons that I observed in this mobile..\\n\\nPros:-\\n1. Long Battery Life.\\n2. Advanced features which are only available in Samsung ecosystem (like \"do not disturb while in driving\" etc.,)\\n3. Can fastly unlock the phone using Fingerprint scanner.\\n\\nCons:-\\n1. Total Weight of Mobile.\\n2. Camera quality is not seems like a 48MP Cam.\\n3. Display quality is also not good.\\n4. Face unlock is just an useless feature in this mobile.\\n5. Last but not least, the worst thing is the processor. A walking turtle would be better than the performance speed of this processor..\\n\\nIf anybody like to buy a mobile in this price range, just go with either Redmi or Realme.. Those brands will really satisfy you a lot (I were a Redmi user and I fully satisfied with the features, that\\'s why I recommended this brand). 👍',\n",
       " \"Just ok for a budget phone not made in chinaPurchased in June.\\n\\nWhat I like\\n\\n-Battery power. I charge it only once in 2 days. Being a medium-to- heavy user\\nit's a big thumbs up.\\n- Storage capacity\\n- Navigation speed\\n- Not made in China\\n\\nWhat I dislike\\n\\n- It's quite heavy!\\n\\n- Eyes hurt within 3 hours. It never happened with any of the phones I have\\nused so far (more than 10 phones ) . Some of them were really cheap too. I\\ndon't know why this phone makes the eyes hurt. I am not a particular fan of\\nEye Comfort Shield feature so this is a big minus point for me.\\n\\n- Camera here truly is just an accessory. Well, anyway, I didn't buy this phone\\nfor cameras, my expectations were already low but the quality of pics are\\neven lower than what I expected.\\n\\n- Screen resolution.\\n\\nIf you have other phones and want a budget secondary phone not made in China this one is good enough. I was sceptical about the performance of an Exynos processor , never used one before, but it seems alright so far.\",\n",

       " \"Not Good, Not BadHey so this is an honest review from my side. I thought Samsung phone would be great for my dad but it isn't so great. The battery life isn't good. Once the battery goes below 50% it drains really fast. Talking about camera quality, it isn't as good as expected. The pictures look grainy.. finger print reader doesn't accepts your finger sometimes, and if you put a cover on your phone then its even harder to use the finger print reader. This phone has good features but ya if I talk about the price it was good for 11k but not perfect!\",\n",

Now, Samsung realise that selling their name is no more working and reduce the price at the level of other company to success in the market . I bought 6 gb one and very happy with it now.\\nHowever, as before, many of the inbuild apps irritating me which are not uninstallable.\\nAfter using it for 3 months plus, let me give my fair opinion:\\n1. Battery life makes me happy, but fast charging needs 2 hrs plus is little bit annoying.\\n2. Camera must not be more than 12 Megapixel. As compared to my previous phone MI Note 6 pro, I dont see any better snap here.\\n3. Finger print sensor is absolutely annoying. Most time i have to enter my password manually as FP sensor do not detect my fingerprint. How my previous phone MI Note 6 pro nicely detects my fingerprint and easily open phone has been missing here.\\n4. As MAH is more, thr weight of phone is bit heavy. I dont know why Silicon cover of around Rs 99 approx cannot be attached here in the package!! I bought silicon cover from Amazon but lately arrived which cause my phone screeen crack due to fallen from my bed. If it was in Silicon cover, the Lcd must have been intact till now. MI 6 Pro had come with one extra phone safety cover but Samsung cannot.\\n5. After two years , I come to Samsung again hoping much UI improvement. However, i found Samsung do not compete with even MI in certain ways. I need to put Alarm clock on, i can easily go directly to all clock setting by clicking wall paper clock in MI while this phone need me to go to the clock in menu and so. When a turn on torch, i can easily turn it off by pressing power button in MI while this phone needs me to open screen and tap on torch icon in menu manually\\nAs off now, i can point out these points to ascertain my judgement. I will comeback after using a year if get time',\n",

Not even FHD but supports 1080 p video viewing\\n- 4 K videos will never play in 4 K mode. Only can be played in 1080 p resolution\\n- No gyroscope and magnetometer sensor which means, compass application and some games which use these sensors will never work\\n- No Corning Gorilla class. Screen is prone to scratches without cover\\n- Sound is below average for music listeners\\n- Double tap doesn’t work to wake up the screen\\n\\nConclusion:\\nOnly go for this if you are using for phone calls with good battery backup. Not worth for entertainment purpose. I can still survive on this as I have an iPad for entertainment.

       " 'processor, battery are ok , Fingerprint sensor,camera and UI not goodAfter a long span of time say 3 years, im back to Samsung. Now, Samsung realise that selling their name is no more working and reduce the price at the level of other company to success in the market . I bought 6 gb one and very happy with it now.\\nHowever, as before, many of the inbuild apps irritating me which are not uninstallable.\\nAfter using it for 3 months plus, let me give my fair opinion:\\n1. Battery life makes me happy, but fast charging needs 2 hrs plus is little bit annoying.\\n2. Camera must not be more than 12 Megapixel. As compared to my previous phone MI Note 6 pro, I dont see any better snap here.\\n3. Finger print sensor is absolutely annoying. Most time i have to enter my password manually as FP sensor do not detect my fingerprint. How my previous phone MI Note 6 pro nicely detects my fingerprint and easily open phone has been missing here.\\n4. As MAH is more, thr weight of phone is bit heavy. I dont know why Silicon cover of around Rs 99 approx cannot be attached here in the package!! I bought silicon cover from Amazon but lately arrived which cause my phone screeen crack due to fallen from my bed. If it was in Silicon cover, the Lcd must have been intact till now. MI 6 Pro had come with one extra phone safety cover but Samsung cannot.\\n5. After two years , I come to Samsung again hoping much UI improvement. However, i found Samsung do not compete with even MI in certain ways. I need to put Alarm clock on, i can easily go directly to all clock setting by clicking wall paper clock in MI while this phone need me to go to the clock in menu and so. When a turn on torch, i can easily turn it off by pressing power button in MI while this phone needs me to open screen and tap on torch icon in menu manually\\nAs off now, i can point out these points to ascertain my judgement. I will comeback after using a year if get time',\n",

I am a frequent traveller and caller so was looking for a budgetary phone which has most of the features along with good battery backup. This meets my requirement.\\nPros:\\n- Fit and finish is very good\\n- Good battery backup\\n- Performance is good with fast response\\n- Storage and ram is sufficient as I opted for 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage variant\\n- Responsive finger printing sensor\\n- Loud and clear sound with and without speaker for calls\\n- Clear voice calling\\n\\nCons:\\n- Heavy weight makes it difficult to hold and use\\n- The screen is HD only. Not even FHD but supports 1080 p video viewing\\n- 4 K videos will never play in 4 K mode. Only can be played in 1080 p resolution\\n- No gyroscope and magnetometer sensor which means, compass application and some games which use these sensors will never work\\n- No Corning Gorilla class. Screen is prone to scratches without cover\\n- Sound is below average for music listeners\\n- Double tap doesn’t work to wake up the screen\\n\\nConclusion:\\nOnly go for this if you are using for phone calls with good battery backup. Not worth for entertainment purpose. I can still survive on this as I have an iPad for entertainment. Samsung is marketing it in such a way where none of the sensors specifications and entertainment features are mentioned clearly on the website as it is not having any of them.

       " 'Couldn\\'t meet my expectationsI expected a lot about samsung mobiles in this price segment, but after buying it I totally regret myself.. But as a reviewer, I would like to post the pros and cons that I observed in this mobile..\\n\\nPros:-\\n1. Long Battery Life.\\n2. Advanced features which are only available in Samsung ecosystem (like \"do not disturb while in driving\" etc.,)\\n3. Can fastly unlock the phone using Fingerprint scanner.\\n\\nCons:-\\n1. Total Weight of Mobile.\\n2. Camera quality is not seems like a 48MP Cam.\\n3. Display quality is also not good.\\n4. Face unlock is just an useless feature in this mobile.\\n5. Last but not least, the worst thing is the processor. A walking turtle would be better than the performance speed of this processor..\\n\\nIf anybody like to buy a mobile in this price range, just go with either Redmi or Realme.. Those brands will really satisfy you a lot (I were a Redmi user and I fully satisfied with the features, that\\'s why I recommended this brand). 👍',\n",
       " \"Just ok for a budget phone not made in chinaPurchased in June.\\n\\nWhat I like\\n\\n-Battery power. I charge it only once in 2 days. Being a medium-to- heavy user\\nit's a big thumbs up.\\n- Storage capacity\\n- Navigation speed\\n- Not made in China\\n\\nWhat I dislike\\n\\n- It's quite heavy!\\n\\n- Eyes hurt within 3 hours. It never happened with any of the phones I have\\nused so far (more than 10 phones ) . Some of them were really cheap too. I\\ndon't know why this phone makes the eyes hurt. I am not a particular fan of\\nEye Comfort Shield feature so this is a big minus point for me.\\n\\n- Camera here truly is just an accessory. Well, anyway, I didn't buy this phone\\nfor cameras, my expectations were already low but the quality of pics are\\neven lower than what I expected.\\n\\n- Screen resolution.\\n\\nIf you have other phones and want a budget secondary phone not made in China this one is good enough. I was sceptical about the performance of an Exynos processor , never used one before, but it seems alright so far.\",\n",

       " \"Not Good, Not BadHey so this is an honest review from my side. I thought Samsung phone would be great for my dad but it isn't so great. The battery life isn't good. Once the battery goes below 50% it drains really fast. Talking about camera quality, it isn't as good as expected. The pictures look grainy.. finger print reader doesn't accepts your finger sometimes, and if you put a cover on your phone then its even harder to use the finger print reader. This phone has good features but ya if I talk about the price it was good for 11k but not perfect!\",\n",

I purchased Samsung's phone hoping to get some amazing performance which the company and other reviewers (mainly YouTube reviewers) claim.\\nI am not that technically sound person to digest every single term the phone companies (manufacturers) use these days. Still, I've gathered a little bit of knowledge and experience after using various smartphones over the long 11-12 years.\\nI got this model (Galaxy M12) exchanged with Redmi 8A Dual which was not that much worse..
